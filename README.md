# 👋 Welcome 👋

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website. The original html, css, and php were acquired from a free Colorlib theme and then further edited from the legend harrisonjanisma himself. His code can be found <a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/harrisonjansma.github.io">here</a> and the template can be found <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/personal/">here</a>. As it was for Harrison, it was also a lot of fun tweaking the HTML to make it my own. Although I had some previous experience with HTML and CSS in the past, it was love at first sight with this template. Thanks again, Harrison!

## Things I learned:
#### 👨‍💻 Basic HTML and CSS manipulation. 
Crazy how simple code can do so much. For editing or creating new features in my portfolio, I tried to reverse-engineer my way to editing the code (aka tracing the code, learning what it does, then work up from there to make it my own).

#### ⚙️ Basic backend setup and deployment.
I deployed the website on GitHub Pages, as it ended up being the most affortable option to host (affortable = free). Although I tried DigitalOcean and hosting through an Apache server, I couldn't get things to work. In the end, I learned about server management, security, and when to pivot to another solution.

#### 💡 Importance of aesthetics to presenting your ideas.
From the influence of Harrison's website, working on this project has taught me a lot about the flow of content, design selection, and ensuring every element is crucial to the function of the website itself.
